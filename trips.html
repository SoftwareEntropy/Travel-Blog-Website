				<h1>Luxury Nepal</h1>
				<p>■ NEPAL, KATHMANDU: 2020 is visit Nepal year and seeing as I've got the budget food and hotel 
				covered in the videos I've made up until now, I decided to investigate what the hotel options 
				for those who truly do not care what they pay for accommodation are.
				My choice of resort thus fell on Dwarika's Resort Dhulikel, about and hour outside Kathmandu 
				with a great view of the Himalayas. I've stayed briefly in luxury hotels and resorts in Sri 
				Lanka and somewhat knew what to expect. But what I wasn't prepared for is how the Nepalese 
				take service in such establishments above and beyond to accommodate their guests and ensure 
				they have a luxurious worry free stay...</p>

				<h1>Tibetan Market & Temple Tour // Delhi</h1>
				<p>Whilst riding a rickshaw through the capital city of India I saw a dark tunnel through 
				the other end of which was a market hidden from the road. And so I decided to investigate 
				and soon discovered a hidden world of busy markets and a peaceful Ladakhi monastery.</p>
