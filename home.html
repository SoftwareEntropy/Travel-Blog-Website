				<h2> About me </h2>
				<p> Greetings! Mike here. Welcome to my travel blog. I was born and raised in New York, and studied
				computer science at <cite>Brooklyn College</cite>. However, after many years of working in the field, 
				I found myself deeply unsatisfied with staying put in the city. I wanted to see more of the world, and 
				so I took a risk; I sold much of what I owned, quit my job, packed my bags, and headed to the closest 
				airport to browse their last minute flights. On these trips, I documented every part of the journey, 
				from the food I ate to the places I visited, and posted them online for supplemental income. One thing 
				led to another, and now I am able to continue doing what I love thanks to patrons and viewers like you. </p>
			</div>

			<div id="findHere">
				<h2> What you can find here </h2>
				<p> This blog will host a variety of content that will allow you to see in detail what 
				I personally encountered on my trips. Trips will be documented in their entirety on my
				<a href = "trips.html"><strong>trips</strong></a> page
				with the highlights of the best and most memorable parts of the trip on my 
				<a href ="highlights.html"><strong>highlights</strong></a> page.
				You will also find a calendar schedule of my anticipated trips and releases on my 
				<a href = "schedule.html"><strong>schedule</strong></a> page.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="support">
				<h2> How can I support you? </h2>
				<p> If you wish to support me, you are free to purchase merchandise from my online store at 
				<a href = "merchandise.html"><strong>my webstore</strong></a>. You may also choose to book 
				your own trips through my affiliate links on the side panel. However, if you do not have 
				the means to support me financially, it is all right! Video views and engagement are just 
				as helpful. Any little bit helps! </p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="other">
				<h2> Other information </h2>
				<p> Business and personal inquiries can be delivered to me through the 
				<a href = "contact.html"><strong>contact</strong></a> form. Refunds and other 
				merchandise related issues can also be directed here.</p>
				<p> If you wish to send me physical mail and/or packages, a P.O. box address will be 
				provided below. P.O. box contents will occasionally be collected when I return or 
				by an aquaintance of mine. Please do not send any perishables.</p>
				<p><em>Thank you for your support</em></p>
